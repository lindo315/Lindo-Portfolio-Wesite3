        The company has a website online, which I choose to focus on in this essay because of its unique design and the product it's advertising. On that note, I'd like to first describe or give a summary of the website's purpose and use. The purpose of the company's website is to provide an online presence for it and to showcase its products, services, and brand. It serves as a digital platform to communicate with customers, potential customers, investors, and other stakeholders. And those being the target audience, they will focus on certain if not different aspects of the website as they use it. With current customers interacting with provided account management tools, support resources, and information about the company's products and services for existing customers. For potential customers, the website showcases Openserve's products and services, pricing, and promotions to attract new customers. And so the target audience varies depending on how people view or want to use the company's services.
      </h2>

      <h3 class="blog-text">
        The website has a couple of interesting main features located in its navigation bar. These features are the Home Page, Get Connected, Products and Services, Discover, Help, Contact, and Search. Going through each of them, they all serve a different purpose that helps the customer (or user), interact with ease with the website and find whatever information necessary to them, provided by the website. The Home page is the landing page of the website, and it provides a sort of summary of the company and some of the services it provides. It doesn't go into much detail, but one can see some of the company's promotions and deals, which the user can click on if they're immediately interested. The Get Connected bar provides information links for services the company provides. As it's called, this bar provides users with several different connection services to the internet. Whether it's business, residential, home, or with customers. It provides different deals and promotions for each, offering good broadband deals specific to the customers' needs. The Products and Services bar provides different categories of services the company has to offer. From Broadband to Internet or Data, Managed Services, and Voice for calls. Discover helps users if they want to know more about Openserve, the Help bar provides a chatbot to “help guide you around the site, answer questions, and direct you to the info you need.” And lastly, the Contact bar provides contact information for the company if users and customers need help with something related to the company.

        Looking at the overall UI present, the website has a simplistic but well-structured and well-styled design. It uses a few design elements to make itself visually appealing and provide a functional interface for users.

        Looking at the overall UI present, the website has a simplistic but well-structured and well-styled design. It uses a few design elements to make itself visually appealing and provide a functional interface for users.
        The Visual Hierarchy. A clear visual hierarchy helps guide users through the website by highlighting important elements and content. This can be achieved through the use of headings, subheadings, font size, colour, and contrast. Starting with headings and font sizes, the Openserve website presents its most important pieces of information of text the company wants users to see first on their website. For example, on the homepage when the user first sees the content of the website, the words FREE are the biggest and boldest, in all caps. As soon as the user notices this, it grabs their attention prompting them to explore whatever deal the website has to offer. Anything that is related to the product they are selling or a service they are offering has a bolder font to grab people's attention. For colour and contrast, the website uses contrasting colours the same as their business logo to create a unique visual aesthetic, using brighter colours like white in the background and darker ones for text (others bolder) in a hierarchy of importance. The more important the information is the bolder or darker the font is. This is to, again, grab the user's attention. Also, the alignment of images and text on the page make it seem more organized and structured properly. Nothing seems to be out of place, even the buttons are aligned just right underneath a block of information related to it.
      </h5>

      <h6 class="blog-text">
        Navigation was already mentioned in detail above. The navigation menu helps users quickly and easily find the information they are looking for and it was achieved through a simple and intuitive menu structure with clear labels and categories. Mostly information links. But Openserve doesn't use a lot of labels (or icons). And this is where visual cues come to play. Visual cues such as icons (or labels), images, and graphics can help guide users through the website and make it more engaging and visually appealing. It also makes it consistent with the use of the right labels, images, fonts, and colours. Making it easier for the user to navigate around the website without confusion. Back to visual cues, the website only has four icons, the search icon for the search bar, the location icon for location, the lock icon for logging in on the website, and lastly, the company's icon, its logo. They all serve as consistent and familiar visual cues for users familiar with navigating websites.
      </h6>

      <h6 class="blog-text">
        The website also uses a few graphics and images that sort of correspond with whatever information they are sharing in that section. The get connected bar shows a rocket graphic as a way (as I see it) to represent a fast connection to wherever the user wants to. The products and services bar uses a box with floating items in it to represent the things the company has in store and can offer to users at fair prices. The website also uses more graphics to show different types of deals and services depending on the customers' needs, like a house graphic for home internet, a business house graphic, an estate graphic, and lastly a server graphic for customer use. Visually, these graphics correspond with the product being advertised by the website.
      </h6>

      <h6 class="blog-text">
        After analysing the UI, I'll now focus on the user experience of the website. How easy is it for users to accomplish their tasks on the website? Are there any obstacles that could hinder the user's experience? How have the design elements and navigation structure impacted the overall usability of the website? I'm using these questions to help guide me in looking at the UX on Openserve's website.
      </h6>

      <h6 class="blog-text">
        When the user enters the website for the first time, the information provided to them on the homepage should not overwhelm them but provide enough information to help them navigate the website and complete a certain task if they have to. I'll refer to that last bit as task accomplishment. The website is designed in a way that makes it easy for users to accomplish their tasks. For example, if a user wants to find information about Openserve's internet plans, they can do so by referring to the navigation bar which is a placeholder for any information or deals the website has about the company. Openserve's navigation on the website is simplistic and uses well-known navigation mechanics with minimal animations that can confuse the user. They focus more on my making it functional than pretty. Which serves well for what it's trying to sell. But if users encounter obstacles such as confusing navigation or slow-loading pages, they may become frustrated and leave the website.
      </h6>

      <h6 class="blog-text">
        But the navigation structure when it comes to the website's links can be an obstacle on its own. Not that they don't work or anything, just that they can be overwhelming at times. Openserve is a large company and it's selling a variety of different services and products. This means that they have to go into detail with most of the products they sell and the deals they have to offer. And sometimes they can't put all that information in one page or two. So they create separate pages for each link, each deal, each product, and each information tab they have for that product. Making the homepage clean, which is good. But it's also flooded with links, and this can make users no longer want to browse through each link to find what they want. Openserve might have tackled this obstacle or issue by creating a search bar and a chatbot to assist new or current users find what they need or ask questions they might have. Another good thing is that users can try and contact the company itself if they have specific needs both the search bar and chatbot can't provide. Though these are the only obstacles I've seen and faced while using the website, I say that it did its best to make everything look clean and functional without bugs. And their assistance services could prove useful to people who find it hard to navigate through the website.
      </h6>

      <h6 class="blog-text">
        This brings me to Ethics. Evaluating the ethics of the interaction design. Does the website prioritize the user's privacy and security? Are there any design elements that could be perceived as manipulative or exploitative? How does the website handle sensitive user data and personal information?
      </h6>

      <h6 class="blog-text">
        From what I've researched, Openserve, as a telecommunications company, may collect and store personal information about its users, such as names, addresses, and payment information. To prioritize the privacy and security of its users' personal information, Openserve has implemented strong security measures such as HTTPS encryption and two-factor authentication. HTTPS encryption ensures that all communication between the user's browser and the Openserve website is encrypted and cannot be intercepted by third parties. Two-factor authentication adds an additional layer of security by requiring users to provide a second form of identification, such as a code sent to their mobile phone, in addition to their password.
      </h6>

      <h6 class="blog-text">
        To add to these security measures, Openserve also provides clear and transparent information about how user data is collected, stored, and used. This can include a clear and accessible privacy policy that outlines what information is collected, how it is stored, and how it is used. Users also have the ability to opt-out of data collection and can be informed if their personal information is ever shared with third parties. Through such prioritizations of the privacy and security of its user's personal information and providing clear and transparent information about its data practices, Openserve's website helps build trust with its users and demonstrates its commitment to ethical interaction design. 
      </h6>

      <h6 class="blog-text"> 
        In this essay, I've analysed the website's UI and noted the effective use of colour, typography, and layout to create a visually appealing navigation structure. In terms of UX design, I found that the website made it easy for users to accomplish their tasks, with clear calls to action and accessible content. However, there were some areas for improvement, such as reducing clutter and streamlining the navigation, there were too many links and pages present, making the site overwhelming at times. In terms of ethics, I observed and explained that the company prioritizes the privacy and security of its user's personal information, provides clear and transparent information about its data practices, and avoids any design elements that could be perceived as exploitative. 
        In conclusion, the company has made a great effort in providing an effective and user-friendly website, while also demonstrating a commitment to ethical practices that prioritize the privacy and security of its users.

    <p class="dev-blog">Exam Essay</p>

    <div class="div-dev2">
      <h1 class="blog-text">
        In the past few years, there has been a rapid growth and advancement in the tech world, and it has brought about some significant changes in the space of the Internet. The rise of AI for one, has changed how we engage with the internet and how people do their work in using that space. In this essay, I will explain and discuss how AI has changed how people interact with the internet, that should we be worried about the growth of AI, and lastly, why the Statement on AI Risk is an important warning about the development of AI that the world should be paying attention to. The Statement on AI Risk was released by the Center for Artificial Intelligence and Society (CAIS) on the grounds of opening a discussion about the development of AI and why disregarding the ethics and monitoring behind it could lead to a global disaster, a threat to humankind that is. It outlines the concerns and potential risks associated with the widespread deployment of AI technologies. The statement has gained much support from leading experts, scholars, and industry professionals who recognize the serious need to address and discuss these risks immediately. By diving deep into what the statement entails and engaging with the arguments put forth by the CAIS signatories, I will share my own opinion on the matter and provide a conclusion with proof of why I hold such an opinion.
      </h1>

      <h2 class="blog-text">
        I believe that this statement is extremely important and there should be global attention on what it has to say. AI has been evolving drastically over the past few years and how it's learning so fast is still a mystery to some. There was a case explained by Mo Gawdat from Google, where he mentions scientists were teaching these AI machines how to mimic human movements and senses but on the arms. The experiment hosted several robot arms controlled by an AI to learn how to see and grab children's toys in front of them. Gawdat saw the experiment and thought it was a waste of time and money because the experiment wasn't producing valuable results. So the machines kept failing. But the following week, one of the robot arms picked up a yellow ball and showed it to the scientists, which one might think was a success, but Gawdat wasn't impressed, thinking all that money was for just one robot to pick up a yellow ball. Then, a week later, all the robot arms could flawlessly pick up yellow balls and other toys without trouble. What troubled Gawdat was the speed at which these machines were learning, and what makes matters worse is that they have a limited understanding of why they learn and why they do it so fast. And that what they are doing is mimicking human intelligence better than humans. Watching that interview shed new light on my view on AI, I was excited about the prospect of it until I realized that scientists themselves aren't too certain about the idea of them and the speed at which they learn, and how perfectly they can mimic human intelligence and speech (ChatGPT and other chatbots).
      </h2>

      <h3 class="blog-text">
        Mo Gawdat mentioned three core rules or barriers he said we shouldn't allow AI to do until we have complete control over AI in general. Those rules were, to not give AI full access to the internet, not teach them how to code because it makes them self-developing, and lastly, not allow them to work with other AI agents with the same access to information or willingness to learn because who knows what they might teach one another. But he mentions that we've crossed all three. Hence the rapid growth of their intelligence over time. I agree with his rules. Firstly, giving AI access to the internet does have its positives but when we have no control over it or have measures put in place to monitor what it learns and at what speed it does so, puts it at risk of learning things it shouldn't. But we don't know how it learns and why it learns so fast, which is a problem. Another issue is that it could come across certain information it might formulate different opinions on depending on what it saw first. What if it was released on the dark web first, or social media full of trolls and people with aggressive racial and religious opinions, or growing conflicts between nations? What stands or opinions would a machine that learns and adapts that fast have on the world in general? It's a frightening thought. Even Sam Altman, co-creator of Open AI, in an interview with ABC7 News, said that people should be a little bit happy that they as the developers of AI are a bit scared of this (the growth of AI). They should be, and I believe they're terrified, not “a little bit scared” as he says in the interview.
      </h3>

      <h4 class="blog-text">
        Secondly, which I believe is the second worse rule already broken, is teaching AI how to code, and giving it autonomous access to social media and even other computers. But that has already happened, there's been a rise of a new AI “assistance” engine called Auto GPT. This AI model is tasked with running on its own in the background and completing subtasks that it set itself under the user's command, but that's not always the case. Auto GPT has been called “the to-do list that does itself”, meaning it can create and complete to-do lists (on your computer), without you doing a thing. For now, it's said to have some bugs and issues, making it barely usable for anything serious. Meaning it's not a threat in any way, at least for now. Because how it works is what worries most people. It's that good at what it does though but can be stuck on loops or bugs that prevent it from completing its tasks. But anyone with a laptop can create their own Auto GPT agent that they can give access to the internet, scrape through it, cross reference information, and write their version of it in seconds. As said before, the results aren't anything impressive, but it's something. Auto GPT is an AI assistant that spawns its own AI assistances to help it complete its tasks, whether it's scraping the web, your computer files, or writing code or malware for you. It creates spammy content and bad code, and it's a disregard for truth and safety. Meaning anyone can access this tool that can copy content, rewrite that content in an undetectable way and post it on the web autonomously. We have given this AI access to the global network (the web) using its custom search engines, has access to databases through API integrations, and it's also allowed to read files, write files, save files, and run files, on any computer it has access to. If it's allowed to continue like this it will be able to write remote-controlled programs RCEs (Remote Controlled Executables), run them, and then spread them to more computers connected to the global network (via social media). And since it can already write malware, even though it's bad at it, given enough time it will get better all the above will become more than a nightmare, but a harsh reality.
      </h4>

      <h5 class="blog-text">
        So far, there have been regulations set or principles put forth to keep track of AI and what it's supposed to abide by. But those haven't been applied, they all sound good but still, experts believe not everyone would adopt these “ethics” and “safety principles” in their AI development because as Mo Gawdat said in one interview, it's already an arms race. They aren't developing these AI tools to better mankind; they're racing to beat the other guy. To come back on topic, I'd like to introduce these five ethics or safety principles to develop safe and trusted AI. I received these five principles from a Forrester article by Brandon Purcell. These are Fairness and Bias, Trust and Transparency, Accountability, Social Benefit, and Privacy and Security. 
        I want to link all these five principles in my own understanding and how we have broken all of them too. The concerns already I've already mentioned by Mo Gawdat, about AI's development and the three core rules he mentioned, align with these principles. Gawdat talked about the importance of maintaining control over AI and avoiding potential risks associated with its unrestrained access to the internet, its ability to self-develop through coding, and its collaboration with other AI agents. When it comes to the principle of fairness, the potential harm caused by giving AI full access to the internet is a valid concern. Without proper monitoring or measures in place to guide AI's learning process, there is a risk of it acquiring inappropriate or biased knowledge. This brings about the idea of the impact of AI's exposure to sources such as the dark web or platforms filled with aggressive and divisive content. The rapid learning and adaptation abilities of AI can lead to the formation of opinions that may not align with ethical principles, posing a worrisome prospect for its impact on the world. As there are other parties out there that are not working on developing AI systems that are for the benefit of mankind, but either from themselves or for their malicious intentions.
      </h5>

      <h6 class="blog-text">
        Also, there's the issue of trust and transparency that emerges when AI is taught how to code and given autonomous access to social media and other computers. With AI systems like Auto GPT out there to use, which autonomously completes tasks, raises concerns about its potential misuse. Although it currently faces limitations, as mentioned before, its ability to generate content, rewrite information, and even create code and malware, is a disregard for truth and safety. This compromises the trustworthiness of AI-generated content and brings forth challenges in identifying the authenticity of the information. These issues call for greater scrutiny and responsible implementation of AI systems. The principle of accountability also comes into play. The complex supply chain involved in AI development raises questions about responsibility when AI systems malfunction or cause harm. The question of who should be held accountable in such situations becomes crucial, and clear guidelines and regulations are required to give attention to this challenge. Proper investigation and understanding of the implications are important to prevent the negative consequences that may come after.
      </h6>

      <h6 class="blog-text">
        With so much on the line, and so many issues and things we currently don't understand about AI, I believe it's fair for everyone to acknowledge that we're dealing with something that has the potential to cause great harm to us as a species and the Statement on AI Risk is out there as proof that experts are aware of this. And they are trying to prevent that before it's too late. I think that it's almost too late, and the world won't listen until something bad happens, say, hackers were able to train an advanced AI system to steal bank information online, or an AI was able to escape onto new servers and developers had no way to track it. It would take something so big and out of this world (something out of a sci-fi movie) before people pay attention to this. But there's another way. With AI getting better at coding, writing, planning, etc, soon people's jobs will be on the line and then people will see why AI is changing things faster than we all realize. To conclude, this statement on AI risk is key to understanding the true danger AI poses and what we can do to stop it before things get completely out of control.
